Welcome to our project conducted at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.cpp.edu/), where we leverage machine learning for early breast cancer detection through image classification.

### Models Explored:
- [Support Vector Machines](https://github.com/timhhsieh/CS4210-Final-Project/blob/main/svm.ipynb)
- [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://github.com/timhhsieh/CS4210-Final-Project/blob/main/knn.ipynb)
- [Decision Trees](https://github.com/timhhsieh/CS4210-Final-Project/blob/main/decision_tree.py)
- [Naive Bayes](https://github.com/timhhsieh/CS4210-Final-Project/blob/main/naivebayes.ipynb)
- [Neural Networks](https://github.com/timhhsieh/CS4210-Final-Project/tree/main/NeuralNetwork)

Our study, using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, focuses on minimizing false negatives, potentially revolutionizing breast cancer diagnostics and improving diagnostic accuracy.
